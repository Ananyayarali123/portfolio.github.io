### *Pollution-Free City*  

*OVERVIEW:*  
Smart Food Management is a system designed to minimize food wastage and ensure efficient distribution of excess food to those in need.

1. Admin Panel:

Dashboard: Displays overall statistics such as the number of donors, receivers, and food donations.

User Management: Allows admins to manage and verify donors and receivers.

Food Donation Management: Monitors active donations, food pickup, and delivery status.

Reports and Analytics: Provides insights into food saved, areas served, and operational efficiency.

Notifications: Sends updates to users regarding donations, pickups, or changes.



2. Donor Panel:

Profile Management: Enables donors to manage their personal and organization details.

Food Donation: Allows donors to post details of available food (e.g., quantity, type, expiry).

History: Tracks previous donations and their outcomes.

Status Updates: Provides real-time updates on donation pickup and delivery status.

Notifications: Alerts donors about pending pickups, approvals, or updates.



3. Receiver Panel:

Profile Management: Enables receivers to update their information and requirements.

Request Food: Receivers can request specific types of food based on availability.

Donation Tracking: Tracks incoming donations and estimated delivery times.

Feedback: Provides feedback on the quality of food and service.

Notifications: Alerts receivers about new donations, approvals, and deliveries.



4. User Authentication:

Registration:

Donors and receivers register with their credentials, including contact details, organization type (if applicable), and verification documents.


Login:

Secure login with email/phone and password. Supports OTP or two-factor authentication for enhanced security.


Role-Based Access:

Users are granted access based on their role (admin, donor, or receiver), ensuring restricted access to sensitive data.


Password Management:

Offers password recovery and change options for users.


*Technical Stack:*  

- *Languages:* C++, Java  
- *Algorithms:* Dijkstra‚Äôs, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)

*Impact:*  
1. Social Impact

Reduction in Hunger: Efficiently redistributes surplus food to those in need, helping to combat hunger and food insecurity.
2. Economic Impact

Cost Savings for Donors: Reduces disposal costs for food producers, retailers, and restaurants by channeling excess food to useful purposes.
3. Environmental Impact

4. Technological Advancement

Data-Driven Insights: Collects data on food waste patterns, helping policymakers and organizations make informed decisions to improve food distribution.
Reduction in Food Waste: Minimizes the volume of food waste that ends up in landfills, curbing methane emissions and reducing environmental degradation.

5. Long-Term Impact

Cultural Shift: Promotes a shift towards a more sustainable and responsible approach to food consumption and waste management.
